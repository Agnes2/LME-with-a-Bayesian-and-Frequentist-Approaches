# LME-with-a-Bayesian-and-Frequentist-Approaches

Data: To run theses scripts we have used the ADNI dataset. We dowlowded the data from adni.loni.usc.edu save as "ADNIdata.csv". Then, we  run the script ADNI_dataset.R to only kept the hippocampus region and 4 time points (baseline, 0.5 years, 1 year and 2 years) of all the visits. We save as "adnidata.csv" needed to run the other scripts.

The file ADNI_dataset: Prepare the downloaded ADNI dataset to run the two LME models (Bayesian and Frequentist).

The file LME_Freq: LME model with a frequentist approach and Hypothesis Testing.

The file LME_Bayesian: LME model with a Bayesian approach and Hypothesis Testing.

The file longitudinal.stan: the document needed for Bayesian approach.
